An EteSync web client. Use EteSync from the browser

# Status

This project is not ready just yet, but it'll hopefully be soon.

After it's ready you'll be able to run it locally and just use a full EteSync
client from the browser!

We will also have a hosted version of this, but it's not as secure as running
your own. More info [here](https://www.etesync.com/faq/#web-client).

# Important!

There are some rough edges at the moment. For example, it uses a static IV
instead of a secure random generated one! Please DO NOT use this for any real
data and encryption keys until this warning is removed.
